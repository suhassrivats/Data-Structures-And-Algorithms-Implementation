- [Space complexity short definitions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of the size of the input.

Simple words : It is the memory required by an algorithm to execute a program and produce output. Similar to time complexity, Space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in big O notation, such as O(n), O(nlog(n)), O(n^2) etc., where n is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.

For any algorithm, memory is required for the following purposes:

1. To store program instructions.
2. To store constant values
3. To store variable values
4. And for few other things like function calls, jumping statements etc.

Auxiliary Space : is the temporary space (excluding the input size) allocated by your algorithm to solve the problem, with respect to input size.

Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.

â€‹		=> `Space Complexity = Input Size + Auxiliary space`

# Coding Patterns

**Sliding Window:**

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList or strings), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists or substrings) of a given size. Sliding Window technique can be used in such cases.

- [Introduction to Sliding Window Algorithms](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/an-introduction-to-sliding-window-algorithms-5533c4fe1cc7)
- [How to Solve Sliding Window Problems](https://medium.com/outco/how-to-solve-sliding-window-problems-28d67601a66)

**Two Pointers:**

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.

- [Introduction to Two Pointer Technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/two-pointers-technique/)
- [Two different approaches of using two-pointer technique](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-two-pointer-technique)

**Fast & Slow Pointers:**

The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.
