        Time Complexity:
        We will check number from 1 to n so it takes O(n) iterations. In each
        iteration, we will check each candidate composition and find minimum of
        them, which takes O(k) time if k is counts of integers that square value
        is less than i in this iteration. Because k will be in range 1 and
        i^(1/2), it takes O(i^(1/2)) time in each iteration. Therefore, totally
        it will take O(1^(1/2)+2^(1/2)+â€¦ +n^(1/2)) = O(n(1+n^0.5)/2)
        = O(n/2 + (n^1.5)/2) = O(n^1.5) time for this approach

        Space Complexity:
        We use a distance list for saving all previous information so it will
        take O(n) space.
