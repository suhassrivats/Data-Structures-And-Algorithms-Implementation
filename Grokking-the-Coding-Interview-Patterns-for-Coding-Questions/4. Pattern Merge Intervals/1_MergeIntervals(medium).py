'''
Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Example 1:
Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into one [1,5].

Example 2:
Intervals: [[6,7], [2,4], [5,9]]
Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].
 
Example 3:
Intervals: [[1,4], [2,6], [3,5]]
Output: [[1,6]]
Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.

  Time complexity
    The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N * logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals.
    We are iterating the intervals only once which will take O(N), in the beginning though,
    since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take O(N * logN).

  Space complexity
    The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals.
    We will also need O(N) space for sorting.
    For Java, depending on its version, Collection.sort() either uses Merge sort or Timsort, and both these algorithms need O(N) space.
    Overall, our algorithm has a space complexity of O(N).
